Built upon [nnUNet](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet/tree/nnunetv1/), this repository provides the solution of Team IMR for [MICCAI 2023 LNQ Challenge](https://lnq2023.grand-challenge.org/lnq2023/). This repository contains the training method and inference code for diseased and mediastinal lymph node segmentation using contrast-enhanced CT scans.

## Environments and Requirements


## Additonal data
In that [LNQ training data](https://lnq2023.grand-challenge.org/data/) are partially annotated (i.e. one node out of five), this solution leverages two additional data with full mediastinal lynph node annotations in training process. Both additional data are publicly available.

## Instructions for running
